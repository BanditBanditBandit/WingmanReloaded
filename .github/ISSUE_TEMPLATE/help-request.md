**Have you already read through the information provided on the wiki?**
[WingmanReloaded Wiki](https://github.com/BanditTech/WingmanReloaded/wiki) has a lot of resources that will help you get set up. Read through the wiki pages to find information about each of the configuration tabs. Some information may be outdated, if so, let me know so that I can update it! For someplace to get started [check out the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/BanditTech/WingmanReloaded/wiki/Trouble-Shooting-Guide)

**Describe the part of the script you are having issues setting up**
What steps have you already taken to set things up, which configurations have you done, what options have you changed.

**Make sure the simple requirements of the script have been met**
 - Fullscreen windowed mode
 - Using a [supported aspect ratio](https://github.com/BanditTech/WingmanReloaded/wiki/Aspect-Ratio) 
 - Update AHK to latest version
