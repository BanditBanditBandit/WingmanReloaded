## Bandit's Comments
This is the continuation of the PoE-Wingman script, my personally modified version released to the public. I have always found several game systems of most ARPG to be rather tedious, and this is my attempt to relieve my stressed wrists and fingers. My main goal is to improve the enjoyment of my time playing Path of Exile, and it has definitely suceeded in that goal!

This script has evolved from a simple flask macro into a Swiss army knife of utilities. It has become an entire suite of tools designed to make playing Path of Exile more enjoyable by reducing the amount of clicking required. There are options for nearly every type of playstyle, including support for Eldridch Battery and Mines. You can customize nearly all the options of the script, including the samples used for image searches. This allows the script to support a much wider variety of screen resolutions and aspect ratios than before.

> As of now, the script is in active development, and setup is not as easy as the original. Find more information in the [**Installation Section**](/main/installation). Because of all the extra options, the GUI has become somewhat bloated. I hope to address this soon :)

This code is derived from [**Andoesk's PoE-Wingman v1.1**](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/mmo/path-of-exile/poe-bots-programs/783680-poe-wingman-auto-flask-auto-quit-more-ahk-pixel.html), which was originally derived from [**Nidark's PoE-Companion**](https://github.com/nidark/Poe-Companion) and inspired by [**Gurud's Beta-Autopot**](https://github.com/badplayerr/beta-autopot/releases/). There are numerous Libraries included in this script as well, credit has been given to the source of the code when possible. Sections related to Predictive Pricing is derived from TradeMacro script, with all the download functions that come alongside that. The logout function was derived from the LutBot lite script. Look in the comments of the Library for more information on the contained functions.

Large portions of the code have been rewritten or refactored. There are countless new functions added, and many more adjustable options. Major improvements include the ability for the script to properly detect health while in delve darkness, and all inventory management and item parsing functions. Other improvements include reducing the reaction speed of the script from well over 300ms to 30-40ms, which means near instant disconnect from burst damage.
