## Flasks Tab

### Flask Settings

> The options for Flasks are arranged in 5 collumns. Assign flask duration in MS, Keys to press, Character Type, and Trigger Types.

Choose between different Triggers: 
* Health Trigger - Either Life or ES
* Quicksilver Group - Trigger with LButton or Attack Keys
* Mana Group - Trigger Group with adjustable threshold on the left.
* Pop Flsk - Triggers all enabled flasks when the hotkey is pressed
  * Options allow this to respect cooldowns of active flasks
  * Options also allow for additional keys of any of the flask slots to also be pressed
* Attack Keys group - Primary and Secondary Attack
  * Assign the keys used as primary and secondary attack on the left

Choose Quicksilver options to adjust delay (in seconds) and associate the Quicksilver group with either of the Attack Keys.

#### Character Type
> This option determines how flasks can trigger, this effects health trigger and Auto-Quit.
* Life uses only Life Triggers, and Auto-Quit is based on Life. 
* Hybrid uses both Life and ES Triggers, and Auto-Quit is based on life. 
* ES only uses ES Triggers, and Auto-Quit is based on ES.

#### Flask Duration
> Assign the duration in MilliSeconds (Time in seconds * 1000)
* This behaves as a cooldown

#### Flask Ingame Key
> Assign the key associated with this flask slot. The very first key is considered the flask slots primary key. You can proceed with a space then any number of additional keys to press when triggering that slot. Some possible keybindings:
* 1
* 1 {RButton} s a d
* {Space} 2345asdf
