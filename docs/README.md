## WingmanReloaded

This is the continuation of the PoE-Wingman script, my personally modified version released to the public. As of now, the script is in active development, and setup is not as easy as the original by a long shot.


## What is it?

> This multi functional script can perform several actions based on states of the game. 
The script can automatically cast Flasks and Abilities based on several triggers: 
    Life, ES, Mana percentages
    Mana and Quicksilver flasks will wait on cooldown as a group
    Quicksilver Flasks trigger with an optional delay with LButton default, and optionaly primary or secondary attack
    Abilities can be assigned to trigger when using a Quicksilver
    With Primary or Secondary attack (Customizable Hotkeys)
    Trigger the flask when the Pop Flasks hotkey is pressed or optionally disable that slot


## How does it get the information?

> It gathers all information without reading from the games memory, so it is a bit safer from a detection standpoint. Primarily the script is using hotkeys intercepted from the keyboard and mouse, and pixel information from the game screen. The script is using incredibly fast screen captures to analyze several areas of the screen at once. It scans an area of the health globes for Life, ES and Mana percentages, and specific pixels on the screen being a set color to determine which panels are open. It also finds the Overhead Health Bar to know when it should pause the script, this setting can be disabled.


## Installation

This script is a much more complex to set up than the original.
I will try and explain each process with detail to provide a clearer instruction to follow.
