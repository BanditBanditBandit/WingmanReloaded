This is the continuation of the PoE-Wingman script, my personally modified version released to the public. I have always found several game systems of most ARPG to be rather tedious, and this is my attempt to relieve my stressed wrists and fingers. My main goal is to improve the enjoyment of my time playing Path of Exile, and it has definitely suceeded in that goal!

One great aspect of the script is how customizable it has become. There are options for nearly every type of playstyle, including support for Eldridch Battery and Mines. And this does much, much more than simply use your flasks. It is an entire suite of tools designed to make playing Path of Exile more enjoyable by reducing the amount of clicking required to do simple repetitious tasks. The best part is that you can customize nearly all the options of the script, including the samples, so you can get it working for your situation.

As of now, the script is in active development, and setup is not as easy as the original. Find more information in the [**Installation Section**](installation).

## Origins of the script

This code is derived from [**Andoesk's PoE-Wingman v1.1**](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/mmo/path-of-exile/poe-bots-programs/783680-poe-wingman-auto-flask-auto-quit-more-ahk-pixel.html), which was originally derived from [**Nidark's PoE-Companion**](https://github.com/nidark/Poe-Companion) and inspired by [**Gurud's Beta-Autopot**](https://github.com/badplayerr/beta-autopot/releases/).

Large portions of the code have been rewritten or refactored. There are countless new functions added, and many more adjustable options. Major improvements include the ability for the script to properly detect health while in delve darkness, and all inventory management and item parsing functions. Other improvements include reducing the reaction speed of the script from well over 300ms to 30-40ms, which means near instant disconnect from burst damage.

## Links

> You can always find the [**Latest Base Release**](https://github.com/BanditTech/WingmanReloaded/releases/latest) on the GitHub project page. The script will update to the most current version on first start. You are given the option to remain at the base version by turning off auto-updates. Sometimes there may be several files listed in the download section of the Release. The files will always be marked with the version number, so download the highest version listed.

> For those wanting to use an older version than the current base release, the entire history of all changes done to the script is available for you to browse in the [**GitHub Commit History**](https://github.com/BanditTech/WingmanReloaded/commits/master). You can download the files of the script as they were at any point in the history of modification.
