# Installation section

> This information will help guide through the several steps to a complete install.

Use the links on the left to select which place to get started, when inside each section you can browse by subject or use the search to find a keyword. If you find that the information you are looking for is missing, please report which information is required, and I will try to add it to the documentation. 

If you are just getting installed, the [basic section](/install/basic) will give you a rundown of the REQUIREMENTS. Please read them, as it prevents unnecessary confusion of how to get the first steps into using the script.

Once you have taken yourself through the foundation of the setup, you can move onto the next steps such as setting up your flasks. You are ready to move onto the [secondary config](/install/secondary).

Once you are comfortable with your "active" configurations, you will want to learn about the powerful item system available within the script. This system is called the [Custom Loot Fister](/install/CustomLootFilter) and is used to stash specific items in specific tabs.
