## Version .13.0002 - Alpha version - November/27/2020
Epic new function to determine Affix perfection of Unique Items
* If the item has a matching entry in the DB, it will create a perfection percentage
* Thanks to the wonderful team behind PoE.Watch we can now price this data point!

Item's are verified against their stat range, and any issues are printed out to the log file  

If you see a message that there was a mismatch, look in the log for the information about the item

Bugfix

---

## Version .13.0001 - Alpha version - November/25/2020
Adjustments to the Parsing backend
* The old method of selective replacement of keys was confusing. It is better to have one standard method, ALL numbers are replaced.
* Now we can match with every possible combination with the most generic solution.  
* If the line contains a range, we average the first two values.  
* Instead of creating a new key named _avg, the avg is saved as the key.    
* All lines with multiple values will simply be stored in _Value(N). This lets any specific key be accessed for evaluation.  
* For non-range lines the first value is stored as the key.

**THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT OF CLF FILTERS TO ADD % SYMBOLS**

so in summary, affix keys for use with CLF will be almost exactly as they appear  
all you need to do is replace numbers with #  
+100 to some stat would be # to some stat  
Such as 23.045 to 234.645 would be # to #  
or 234.45-234.234,34-56.56 would be #-#,#-#  

Other changes:
* fix for double tap mines
* fix for error when launching clf and findtext gui
* fix for util gui text not hiding
* groups for flasks renamed to f[1-5]
