## Version .10.0005 - Alpha Branch - February/21/2020

Added proper scaling to the Fill metamorph function for 43:18 resolution  
Thanks to Hx2600 for starting a fork to add better support for that aspect

Work has begun on developing a much nicer looking webpage for the script  
I used a styling template that looks awesome from ChunJee’s github page

---

## Version .10.0004 - Alpha Branch - February/19/2020

Removed the need for a seperate background script to do quicksilver and controller  
  * This reduces the overall cpu draw of the script even further  
  * the function of quicksilvers has been moved back into the main script  
  * Quicksilver overlay migrated to main script

> **For now controller support is not active (the remaining code in GottaGoFast) I have a working testbench for even better controller support coming soon**


Added a few bases to crafting, I want to make this editable from the GUI

Commented out the lines that used to feed information about cooldowns to subscript

Cleaned up code for mana triggers

Rewrite of the Quicksilver trigger logic, it no longer hangs the script with keywait

Adjustments to how it detects game window, more re-using the last checked var every 5 seconds 
  * if it has not found the game exe, it will look for any others

---

## Version .10.0003 - Alpha Branch - February/17/2020

Reduced idle cpu usage when no game process found
* Changed how most winexist or winactive look for the game using the GameStr var 
* this reduces cpu usage by only asking first for the last found exe

Bugfix for auto check update always using 15 minutes (had left an old static variable)

attack key triggered Flasks and utilities will now fire on the next cycle of game logic  
this is to give the game time to process the initial attacks first

---

## Version .10.0002 - Alpha Branch - February/17/2020

Stack Release tool added to utility tab 
* Searches for a buff icon, then if found searches for the stack capture

* You can adjust the offset it looks for the stack count 
  * The area defaults to the bottom left to bottom right of the buff icon

* To enable this feature, select a pricepoint then the percentage of that price 
  * It defaults to 100 percent (the estimated values themselves) and Off pricepoint

If the flask has been augmented it will use its actual quality value  
This is because quality 20 flasks only vendor on their own if not augmented  
This function still needs some more attention, not sure why random miscounts
