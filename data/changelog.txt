## Version .13.0202 - Alpha version - June/23/2020
Expanding the idea of Custom Code
* ./save/MyCustomRoutine.ahk added
* Code can now be included into the main logic loop

---

## Version .13.0201 - Alpha version - June/23/2020
The Liberation is here!

* Script Libraries have been split to ./lib/

Custom code is now included from save folder

## Version .13.02 - Master version - June/21/2020
Introducing a New update method
* We now use 7z to backup and install
* Makes a backup of the script when updating
* Updating now updates all files, not just main files
* Update is now just one zip File, and is MUCH faster

To complete the update process and ensure full install
* Once script restarts from update
  * Right click the tray icon, then force update once more
  * It will use the new update method to reinstall the script
  * You should now have no worries going forward for future updates!

With this new update method is a lot of freedom!
It allows me to change the file structure of the script,
without being burdened by ever increasing lists of files to be updated.

The script has become a behemoth of code inside the two files.
It has been way past time to seperate all the libraries out into their respective files,
and this is exactly what I needed to do before that could happen.
I look forward to an easier to edit codebase in the near future!

---

---

## Version .13.0001 - Alpha version - November/25/2020
Adjustments to the Parsing backend
* The old method of selective replacement of keys was confusing. It is better to have one standard method, ALL numbers are replaced.
* Now we can match with every possible combination with the most generic solution.  
* If the line contains a range, we average the first two values.  
* Instead of creating a new key named _avg, the avg is saved as the key.    
* All lines with multiple values will simply be stored in _Value(N). This lets any specific key be accessed for evaluation.  
* For non-range lines the first value is stored as the key.

**THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT OF CLF FILTERS TO ADD % SYMBOLS**

so in summary, affix keys for use with CLF will be almost exactly as they appear  
all you need to do is replace numbers with #  
+100 to some stat would be # to some stat  
Such as 23.045 to 234.645 would be # to #  
or 234.45-234.234,34-56.56 would be #-#,#-#  

Other changes:
* fix for double tap mines
* fix for error when launching clf and findtext gui
* fix for util gui text not hiding
* groups for flasks renamed to f[1-5]
