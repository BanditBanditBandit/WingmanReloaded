## Version .13.0001 - Alpha version - November/24/2020
Adjustments to the Parsing backend
* The old method of selective replacement of keys was confusing. It is better to have one standard method, ALL numbers are replaced.
* Now we can match with every possible combination with the most generic solution.  
* If the line contains a range, we average the first two values.  
* Instead of creating a new key named _avg, the avg is saved as the key.    
* All lines with multiple values will simply be stored in _Value(N). This lets any specific key be accessed for evaluation.  
* For non-range lines the first value is stored as the key.

**THIS CHANGE WILL REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT OF CLF FILTERS TO ADD % SYMBOLS**

so in summary, affix keys for use with CLF will be almost exactly as they appear  
all you need to do is replace numbers with #
+100 to some stat would be # to some stat
Such as 23.045 to 234.645 would be # to #  
or 234.45-234.234,34-56.56 would be #-#,#-#  

Other changes:
* fix for double tap mines
* fix for error when launching clf and findtext gui
* fix for util gui text not hiding
* groups for flasks renamed to f[1-5]
