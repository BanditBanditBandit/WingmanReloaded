# GUI Documentation Index

> This documentation page contains information about every GUI panel of the script. I have tried to be as verbose as possible when discribing what each option can do.

The menu is grouped based on which GUI panel the setting is located. Use the sidebar to find the options you are looking for. Or use the search feature to look for it that way.
