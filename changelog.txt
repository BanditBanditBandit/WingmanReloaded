Version .03 August/06/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created a new utility Function
    It can now be expanded to support any number of utilities
    Input Utility name and it manages all the cooldowns and keys.
    I put all the settings together for easily adding more.
    As of now, PhaseRun and VaalDiscipline are supported utility skills.

Cooldowns from main script will go directly to subscript
    The two scripts now have a way to communicate which flasks are on cooldown.

Script will not remove focus from game window.
    Now when Loading the script or pressing the save button, it will make
    the game window focused if the window exists.

Fixed the script from stealing focus from game.
