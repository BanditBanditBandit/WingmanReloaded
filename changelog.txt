Release Notes

Version .09.00 December/22/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------Script has been converted to RGB-------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------Update Will Require re-install and transition script-------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created a transition script that will take old settings.ini and update
    It asks to move all profiles into their own profiles.ini file
    It asks to swap all BGR values to RGB
    It asks if you want to delete your old Loot Colors key
        This is to allow for using the new FilterBlade pack colors

It is an easy process to check if its all working, check gamestates to confirm
If they are not registering, go to hideout and run the wizard
Once your done, save your configuration and your new samples are set!

The reason for all this adjustment, is to standardize the script for a faster method
Complete replacement of PixelGetColor with ScreenShot and ScreenShot_GetColor
    This provides a massive speed increase for all the pixel sampling
    Instead of sampling the screen multiple times, we capture once and reuse
    This also solves issues of false positives where the screen has changed

Massive speed boost for the script, cutting the overall flask MS time to 40-90ms
    We can sample as many screen positions in our status check with marginal difference
Same change has been done to the inventory scan, and its MUCH faster now
    The things slowing it down was moving the mouse and empty slots
        Screenshoting the inventory removes the need to move the mouse away each collumn
        And sampling the status of each slot has become nearly instantaneous

This new speed does come at the cost of processing power
    Old script was around .7% and this can be 4-9% load

Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .09.00 December/20/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loot Vacuum has been adjusted to remove the need of flipping from BGR to RGB
If you have custom colors set up for the loot vacuum, you will want to swap R and B
    I would recommend using the transition script to swap the colors
    Load the loot vacuum settings to confirm the colors are correct

All default samples have been updated for the latest patch using RGB
    It is still recommended to do calibration

All samples now use ScreenShot_GetColor instead of PixelGetColor

Added Doors to the openable list for Loot Vacuum

First load seeks to end of file if log too large

Fixed Elemental DPS parser, now gives readout of all added ele damage
    was only parsing the first elemental damage before, now parses all fields

Basic implimentation of an affix count has been introduced to the parser
    Does not account for all double affixes, but I put exceptions for unique ones
    Double basic affixes will be more difficult to determine if its an extra line

Added suggestion by danmarzola for Organ Parts
    Prop.IsOrgan will read the type of organ it is for further matching with CLF
    to match for specific type use ~ Heart|Lung|Brain|Liver|Eye
    Or match Prop.SpecialType = Organ

Adjustments to the way JSON files are stored
    Saved in pretified format
    Bases.json has been updated to remove unnecessary clutter
    Ninja.json is no longer one line

Default league updated to Metamorph for Ninja Parser

Rewrite of how implicits and corruptions are parsed
    This helps with simplifying the affix count

Matches Vaal Skillgems properly now
    Use Prop.VaalGem with the CLF to sort them

Added Stash tab option for Organs and Support Gems

Item Parser displays Custom Loot Filter matching group and the tab it will go

Loot Vacuum now lets go of left or right mouse when its about to click
    Returns your mouse to its former state afterwards
    This lets you move or cast skills while looting

MoveStash now optionally checks for GuiStatus("OnStash") to not interfere with screenshot

Rewrite of Hex2FindText to allow for any shape of rectangle or square

Loot Vacuum will allow for looting while holding down RButton
	It now stops LButton
	
AutoSkillup now only fires when your not holding a mouse button down

Now detects for Quest items and skips them

FilterBlade URL has been added to the FilterBlade.zip file
    this lets you load the filter and customize which things hide or show

Reworked the output from GuiStatus
    It now returns true when OnChar and No panels are open

GottaGoFast updated to use new GuiStatus checks
