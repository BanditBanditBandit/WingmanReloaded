Release Notes .04 August/10/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the last release there has been a lot of work done to the script!

Backend improvements to how the script handles your settings, as well as making
profiles easier to use and centralizing all the relevant settings. With the 
introduction of the utility section I figured it was time to move it around.
Also how it handles Mana and Quicksilver flasks has been vastly improved. Now it
creates a list of all the flasks that are off cooldown, and goes through the list
in order when the previous one finishes cooldown.

People using scaled versions of the script should see improvements with how the
inventory sort function works. Sauron-Dev has been testing on a scaled resolution
and added some great changes to how it determines empty inventory slots.

Additions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fully fleshed out Utility function
    5 Generic utility keys that can be configured to:
        Fire on cooldown if there are no combination of triggers below
        Trigger when pressing a Quicksilver
        Trigger when at 20-90% Life
        Trigger when at 20-90% ES

Utility Management has been added to profiles
    Configure Each utility for a specific build!
	Now with all the settings in one place that profiles save and load

Profiles which have not been used now act as a blank slate for the GUI
    Press the load # button on a slot you have not used to unselect everything

Sauron-Dev has added:
    New method of determining items in inventory, should now scale without issues
    New calibration button to determine empty item slots colors
    New function to return an index of matching values from an array
	New function to deal with strings and arrays

Using Sauron-Dev's additions
    Implimented the same changes for Mouseover color
    Added calibration button to determine Mouseover Colors

Added Ding() function for debugging
    Can take up to 7 lines of input strings
    These only show when debug is checked

Added a timer for checking if the attack key has been held down
    Good news for those builds that holds down one key *META CYCLONE*
	
Added option to turn off Auto-Update


UI Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-Organized the Tabs of the GUI, combined several tabs together.
    All Flasks and Utilities related options are now presented together in one page

Set default INI settings straight from the ReadFromFile() in both scripts
    This should fix any further issues with loading from incomplete settings.ini
