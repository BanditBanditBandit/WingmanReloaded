Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .08.00 December/06/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated library for FindText() function
    Lib now offers ways of capturing and manipulating screenshots
        using this I have reduced the delay of the OHB from +400MS to ~100MS
        incidentally this also fixes issues with the healthbar quickly moving
    Lib has improved edit menu that remains the same size when scaling area
        you can now scroll the edit panel to select the correct pixels
    Can now assign a screenshot hotkey in the findtext GUI
        grab a screenshot and go back to capture buffs / debuffs later
    Can now test strings straight from the clipboard

General adjustments for other parts of the scripts that use FindText()
    Coordinate input has been adjusted to match the new format
    GGF script finally utilizes variables coming from the Rescale function
        Should allow for people using a secondary monitor to play the game

Opening the FindText GUI is now its own thread seperated from the main script
    This allows for using the screenshot feature without it being overwritten
    Pressing escape will exit the app while its active, closing the window as well
        Minimize allows you to keep it open for using the screenshot hotkey

Introducing Advanced Hotkeys library for easier binding of hotkeys
    as a proof of concept I have modified the FindText lib Screnshot hotkey to use this
    Double click on the binding editbox to bring up the hotkey assignment window

Also added DynaRun and CreateScript in library for later use
    These allow for scripts which can be run in a seperate thread
