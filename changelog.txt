--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cooldowns from main script will go directly to subscript
    The two scripts now have a way to communicate which flasks are on cooldown.

Created a new utility Function
    It can now be expanded to support any number of utilities, input name
    of the Utility to fire and it manages all the cooldowns and keys.
    I put all the settings together for easily adding more.

As of now, PhaseRun and VaalDiscipline are supported utility skills.

Script will not remove focus from game window.
    Now when Loading the script or pressing the save button, it will make
    the game window focused if the window exists.

Fixed the script from stealing focus from game.

added timer to tooltip on save, removes after 5s

Quicksilver flasks now fire sequentially without skipping!

Show on start option is now respected

Added link to Wiki page and donation to tray tip

Added auto-update function, will now be tracking version online.
