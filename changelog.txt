--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standardized town names for adding Town specific vendors later
Created a function to compare a value to an array of arrays and return parent index
    All towns have been grouped with their translations
    CompareLocation can now return the english name of the current town

Item bases updated for 3.9 located %A_ScriptDir%\Data\Bases.json
    Update for the location of the Item Bases
    Delete old file and reload script to update that, or download from master github

Quest items are now auto clicked by Loot Vacuum!
    Will click the Green text, this includes new league mechanic

Version .08.07 December/13/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for Vendor after stash
    was not searching entire screen like it was supposed to

Fixes for Auto-Quit
    Bugfix for 50 and 60% threshold quit
    Bugfix for portal quit, release mouse buttons so it can cast portal

Adjusted Skillup string again by 2 shades
    Was clicking greyed out skills, update to new default on strings tab
    Also checks if you have the options screen open
        Was getting false positives when there was greyed out skill on options

Version .08.06 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for Auto-Skillup

Version .08.05 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese parser fixed

Client.txt language is now detected automatically on load

Version .08.04 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese, Korean, German, Russian, French, Portuguese, and Thai added
    This should cover all the different available languages
    These translations require you to encode your Client.txt file in UFT-8-BOM
    In notepad, open client.txt then save as, open encoding dropdown > UFT-8 with BOM
        This fixes accents and special characters

Added log output for zone change when the C log debug messages option is checked

Version .08.03 December/11/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for the Client.txt file load
    Was getting caught in a loop of reading the file contents
    new method reverses the file when first reading it
        this allows for a standard parse loop which is much more reliable
    This should fix any script hangups on load

Improved the auto Skillup string, new default string to use
    This needs to be manually updated, click and select new default in dropdown
    New string has 100% match rate for skillup while not clicking greyed out ones
    This also makes it much faster :D

I have added in the system for parsing different laguages of Client.txt files
    I have been able to add Spanish, looking for submissions to add more languages
    Look for new option in Configuration tab, under where you choose file location
    I added comments into the code for anyone attempting to make translations

Library update to FindText 7.1
    He has developed a better way of inserting the Text:="|<>ResultColor" lines
    also added new functions for PicLib, PicInfo

Version .08.02 December/07/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added a check for being on character before resampling health and mana values
    This affects the Save Configuration button
    Will receive messagebox prompts if there is an issue resampling
    will not resample if script cannot detect being on character
    If everything checks out, it instead displays a tooltip that it's all clear

Version .08.01 December/07/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick patch to fix Location issue with Syndicate Hideout
    Since I assumed any zone with word Hideout was a Hideout, it paused script
    It now makes an exception for this zone

Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .08.00 December/06/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated library for FindText() function
    Lib now offers ways of capturing and manipulating screenshots
        using this I have reduced the delay of the OHB from +400MS to ~100MS
        incidentally this also fixes issues with the healthbar quickly moving
    Lib has improved edit menu that remains the same size when scaling area
        you can now scroll the edit panel to select the correct pixels
    Can now assign a screenshot hotkey in the findtext GUI
        grab a screenshot and go back to capture buffs / debuffs later
    Can now test strings straight from the clipboard

General adjustments for other parts of the scripts that use FindText()
    Coordinate input has been adjusted to match the new format
    GGF script finally utilizes variables coming from the Rescale function
        Should allow for people using a secondary monitor to play the game

Opening the FindText GUI is now its own thread seperated from the main script
    This allows for using the screenshot feature without it being overwritten
    Pressing escape will exit the app while its active, closing the window as well
        Minimize allows you to keep it open for using the screenshot hotkey

Introducing Advanced Hotkeys library for easier binding of hotkeys
    as a proof of concept I have modified the FindText lib Screnshot hotkey to use this
    Double click on the binding editbox to bring up the hotkey assignment window

Also added DynaRun and CreateScript in library for later use
    These allow for scripts which can be run in a seperate thread
