Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .08.12 December/16/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found a change made to the Clipboard contents, Implicit is now flagged in-line
    This makes it much easier to ensure we grabbed the implicits
Other Additions to the parser:
    Increased Damage/Attack speed with movement skills

Added Cocoon and Bundle to the list of Opened containers with LootVacuum

Reverted the Client.txt load system back until I can figure out why its crashing
    This old method has a known issue with files over the memory limit.
    If your file is too large, your location will show up as "Log too Large"
    When loading large log file, you will need to zone change to update location

FindText Library has been updated to version 7.2
    This version is a function update, I helped discover a potential crash situation
    This situation was not present in the script, found in a testbench I was working on
    Another change resolves the mouse flicker that was present when using ScreenShot()
        This was only used in delve, and was not extremely noticable
        This will allow me to redisign the GuiStatus function to use this new faster method

Version .08.11 December/16/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loot Vacuum can now automatically open Chests, Trunks and Racks
    Enable or disable in the Loot vacuum settings
    You can also edit the string to add more containers or for your resolution

Vendor after stash now works in Town, Mines or Hideout
    Detects which town you are in no matter your language
    Searches for the Vendor that is closest to the stash
    Will attempt to move toward vendor in difficult towns (Azurite Mines, Docks, Sarn)

All town vendors have been added to the strings tab for customization

Version .08.10 December/15/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trying to catch the error thats going on with the log loader for some
    I prefer this method because it doesnt put the contents of the file in memory
    but people are randomly having issues so here is another revision
    This time we return with no exception, each line is returned including blank
    One line is returned at a time no matter what now for simplicity

I also wrapped the section in a try/catch, but im not sure this will help or not?
    Then I added an exception for if it loops a million times, which it should never
    This seems like some kind of loadtime error, so not sure

Changed how many log messages there are, and how it behaves
    C log will work in background if you disable debug messages, and write to log
        this makes it easy to add new towns for later
    If both enabled it shows the tooltips on the left as well
    Only the main script will log language detection and initialization message

Version .08.09 December/15/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted Skillup string again by 2 shades more strict
    update to new default on strings tab
Re-arranging the string tab to make room for town vendors

Library stuff - Changes and additions
    CompareHex has been renamed CompareRGB, new function named CompareHex
        CompareHex will accept RGB or BGR hex input and compare within variance
    Function added to library to build Findtext strings from single pixel color
        Can accept arrays of colors or individually, and assign variance
        Use this to build 1 or 5 pixel squares to use for searching colors

Loot Vacuum adjustments and improvements
    Loot Vacuum now uses the FindText strings from Hex2FindText
        Searches all colors at once instead of individually
        This makes it much much faster, once again FindText library coming through!
    Now that we search faster, we can add more colors
        Add or remove sets of colors for your own custom filter colors
        As always ensure the background is not transparent or it will not match
        Will not let you remove the last set of colors
    Default color order has been flipped, rarer items prioritized
        Quest color is now also first

Reverted Client.txt first scan method, no longer flips file contents
    I think I have found all the issues, and client will parse as long as encoded
    Just simply stops after 1000 loops if it still has not found location
        Will write to log informing that you may need to encode your file with BOM
    This method had no issues with large files, no need to load into memory

Decided next major version I will finally swap all values using BGR to RGB
    This will allow for consistency between different parts of the script
    But will cause a need to recalibrate all samples which are using BGR

Version .08.08 December/13/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standardized town names for adding Town specific vendors later
Created a function to compare a value to an array of arrays and return parent index
    All towns have been grouped with their translations
    CompareLocation can now return the english name of the current town

Item bases updated for 3.9 located %A_ScriptDir%\Data\Bases.json
    Update for the location of the Item Bases
    Delete old file and reload script to update that, or download from master github

Quest items are now auto clicked by Loot Vacuum!
    Will click the Green text, this includes new league mechanic

Version .08.07 December/13/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for Vendor after stash
    was not searching entire screen like it was supposed to

Fixes for Auto-Quit
    Bugfix for 50 and 60% threshold quit
    Bugfix for portal quit, release mouse buttons so it can cast portal

Adjusted Skillup string again by 2 shades
    Was clicking greyed out skills, update to new default on strings tab
    Also checks if you have the options screen open
        Was getting false positives when there was greyed out skill on options

GuiStatus can return true or false when called for a single status

Version .08.06 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for Auto-Skillup

Version .08.05 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese parser fixed

Client.txt language is now detected automatically on load

Version .08.04 December/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese, Korean, German, Russian, French, Portuguese, and Thai added
    This should cover all the different available languages
    These translations require you to encode your Client.txt file in UFT-8-BOM
    In notepad, open client.txt then save as, open encoding dropdown > UFT-8 with BOM
        This fixes accents and special characters

Added log output for zone change when the C log debug messages option is checked

Version .08.03 December/11/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for the Client.txt file load
    Was getting caught in a loop of reading the file contents
    new method reverses the file when first reading it
        this allows for a standard parse loop which is much more reliable
    This should fix any script hangups on load

Improved the auto Skillup string, new default string to use
    This needs to be manually updated, click and select new default in dropdown
    New string has 100% match rate for skillup while not clicking greyed out ones
    This also makes it much faster :D

I have added in the system for parsing different laguages of Client.txt files
    I have been able to add Spanish, looking for submissions to add more languages
    Look for new option in Configuration tab, under where you choose file location
    I added comments into the code for anyone attempting to make translations

Library update to FindText 7.1
    He has developed a better way of inserting the Text:="|<>ResultColor" lines
    also added new functions for PicLib, PicInfo

Version .08.02 December/07/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added a check for being on character before resampling health and mana values
    This affects the Save Configuration button
    Will receive messagebox prompts if there is an issue resampling
    will not resample if script cannot detect being on character
    If everything checks out, it instead displays a tooltip that it's all clear

Version .08.01 December/07/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick patch to fix Location issue with Syndicate Hideout
    Since I assumed any zone with word Hideout was a Hideout, it paused script
    It now makes an exception for this zone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patch Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version .08.00 December/06/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated library for FindText() function
    Lib now offers ways of capturing and manipulating screenshots
        using this I have reduced the delay of the OHB from +400MS to ~100MS
        incidentally this also fixes issues with the healthbar quickly moving
    Lib has improved edit menu that remains the same size when scaling area
        you can now scroll the edit panel to select the correct pixels
    Can now assign a screenshot hotkey in the findtext GUI
        grab a screenshot and go back to capture buffs / debuffs later
    Can now test strings straight from the clipboard

General adjustments for other parts of the scripts that use FindText()
    Coordinate input has been adjusted to match the new format
    GGF script finally utilizes variables coming from the Rescale function
        Should allow for people using a secondary monitor to play the game

Opening the FindText GUI is now its own thread seperated from the main script
    This allows for using the screenshot feature without it being overwritten
    Pressing escape will exit the app while its active, closing the window as well
        Minimize allows you to keep it open for using the screenshot hotkey

Introducing Advanced Hotkeys library for easier binding of hotkeys
    as a proof of concept I have modified the FindText lib Screnshot hotkey to use this
    Double click on the binding editbox to bring up the hotkey assignment window

Also added DynaRun and CreateScript in library for later use
    These allow for scripts which can be run in a seperate thread
