Version .06.00 September/23/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

********************************************************************************
******************* DO NOT AUTO UPDATE TO THIS VERSION *************************
********************************************************************************
******************* WILL CRASH ON LAUNCH IF MISSING LIB ************************
********************************************************************************
Redisigned the Item parse debug system into the new Item Info GUI
    You can quickly look at the price graphs of items and its parsed info
    It shows the Prop, Stats, and Affix arrays for use with custom loot filter
    The two graphs either show the Buy and Sell or the Value and Low Confidence
        Low confidence graphs are based on low volumes of trade

Added Calibration Wizard which will gather all the samples at once
    Gives step by step instructions while waiting for "A" keypress
    Cancel the Wizard by holding Escape when pressing "A"

Added tooltips to all the options on the Configuration tab
    A lot of people seem to have issues with getting the calibration done
        This will hopefully give some more direction to those having issues
    These tooltips along with the Wizard will help a lot of people

Quivers and Flasks have been added to Stats.ItemClass

The script has been completely restructured
    Several non dependant functions have been moved into the Library.ahk file
    Functions have been moved around and grouped together where possible
    Labels have been added to most comments for top down view navigation

Version .05.11 September/22/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added Ignored Inventory slots menu, open in the inventory tab
    Check any box which you want the inventory scanner to skip
    Wisdom and Portal scroll locations are automatically skipped already
        The slots they occupy will not appear to be checked, but they are skipped

Reverted the ItemScan to only check for Empty Slots
    Reverted the need to check for variation from the sample colors 

Added BlackList array to remember which slots are occupied
    Using the IgnoredSlot array we create the BlackList each time we run ItemSort
    Each item is added to the blacklist using its Width and Height
        Report any item types that doesnt have an assigned Width x Height
    This should limit items to get clipped only ONCE
    The speed of the scanner is now the fastest it can get!

Calibration for Inventory Colors has been Reverted
    Mouseover, ID, and UnID are no longer required.
    Simply provide an empty inventory to calibrate!
        has been moved back into Gamestate Calibration section

Added Array_DeepClone library for cloning an array multiple arrays deep
    Ty to GeekDude for the code, only using part of the lib
    https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/85201-array-deep-copy-treeview-viewer-and-more/

Fixed sleep between sending Unique to stash and Checking if it is gone
    Was still moving to secondary tabs even when Item was gone

Next Patch will include Graphs for 6.0 with new interface for the item parse

Version .05.10 September/20/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Patch Requires Calibration of OnMenu**
    Open either the Atlas or Talent skills panel then calibrate OnMenu

**First Launch will take more time**
    It will download and condense the PoE.Ninja databases into one file
    The script is now loading a sizable database into memory compared to before.

Added new Tab to the Config GUI for the Item Parse system
    option for turning it off
    option for frequency of the database update
    option for League name
    button to update league info
    Todo GUI:
        provide new filters for chaos value and exalt value
        Make new hotkey just for clipping item

New XGraph Library has been installed which allows us to graph the plotpoints
    this will be part of the next patch.
    I have already gotten the test script showing working graphs

Changed OnAtlas to OnMenu
    Since this affects both Atlas and Talent skills panel

Improvements for parser
    Splits itemname into ItemName and ItemBase
    Corrupted included in list of props available
    Added GemLevel to list of Stats
    Encodes the variant for matching skillgems 
        "GemLevel"/"Quality""corrupted"
        "21/23c" is 21 level 23 quality corrupted gem
        anything < lvl 20 with < 15 quality will be matched as "20" version
            if lvl < 20 & quality > 15 it will be matched as "1/20" version
    There are other items in the database with variants undone
        beyond skillgems it doesn't match for variant

Added a new scraper to grab PoE League data
    This will auto-populate the dropdown list for choosing your league.
    You only grab the league info one time, then you manually update it.
        any fresh install will grab this automatically.
        this is to limit us pinging the PoE servers for data

Added a new scraper to grab PoE ninja chaos value data
    Items become flagged with Prop.ChaosValue and Prop.ExaltValue
    Currency and Fragments only have ChaosValue
    Graphs of information to come!

Parses these PoE.Ninja API: Currency, Fragment, Prophecy, DivinationCard, Map, 
    Essence, UniqueArmour, UniqueFlask, UniqueWeapon, UniqueAccessory, Beast,
    UniqueJewel, UniqueMap, SkillGem, Scarab, Oil, Incubator, Resonator, Fossil

Version .05.09 September/16/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increased stash list to 31 tabs, beyond that is unknown how it will behave

Custom loot filter GUI now remembers Maximized state and window position

Added Breachstone to parser with flags:
    Prop.BreachSplinter and Prop.SpecialType="Breachstone"

Can now hit escape to close any script GUI window

Added Numpad0 as default modifier for stash tab hotkeys
    This will allow typing with the Numpad keys normally
    only affects fresh install

Bugfix for Lootvacuum
    will no longer get stuck holding down left mouse button

Version .05.08 September/15/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Patch Requires Recalibration of Inventory**

Returned the Id/Vend/Stash to checking for Unidentified and Identified colors
    This should speed up the script drastically when dealing with inventory
    The most times an item should be clipped is twice
        Will eventually get this down to once by using Prop.Width and Prop.Height

Rewrote the Inventory calibration section
    It now samples two colors per Calibration
        Identified items and Empty slots
        UnIdentified items and Mouseover color
    This now requires much less setup from the User
    Now you only need ONE unid or red item, and ONE identified item 
        Any item that has a red background can be used for UnId
        Gems with too high requirements are useful for this (they have red backgrnd)
    Place the single item in the first slot of an empty inventory to calibrate
    Requires 1x1 items (An item which is only one slot wide and high)
    Input is blocked while running calibration for these

Added new function to compare a hex value to an array of hex values
    indexOfHex(hexVal, hexArr, fromIndex, variance)
    default is variance of 2

Reclip items after they become identified.

Adjusted delays in SwiftClick, ShiftClick and CtrlClick by +15ms
    allow the button to register being released
    most delays are standardized now

Adjusted default values for INI read of Chat and Stash hotkeys prefix
    Now properly loads blank values when fresh install

Adjusted ItemSort to add delay before resampling Unique items
    Makes sure that the item has a chance to leave inventory
    This now works as intended, if not transfered it attempts next tab
        Tab Priority:
        Collection tab > Unique Ring Tab (if ring) > Unique Dump tab

Version .05.07 September/14/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
forgot to fix overlap on the calibration section

Version .05.06 September/14/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugfix for AlternateGemY not being loaded properly
Added request for OnAtlas state
    thank you for the contributions danmarzola
    they have been helping to point out typos in the code

Added hex color comparison function for later use
    ToRGB(hexcolorVar) and CompareHex(rgbVar1,rgbVar2,varianceNum)

Version .05.05 September/13/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added PseudoTotalResist and PseudoTotalEleResist to affixes
Prop.Width and Prop.Height default to 1 now

Updated FilterBlade zip for the last few background colors to Black
    to updated these you need to manually extract them to their correct location
    C:\Users\  UserName  \Documents\My games\Path of Exile

Removed the icon file for GGF as it is no longer needed
    Removed the load lines for tray icon from GottaGoFast

Bugfix patch
    Fix missing BeltBases global
    
Version .05.02 September/12/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added the ability to match mutliple strings in one Group item
    Using the ~ evaluator you can now use | between each string
    so wand|shield will match for Wands or Shields in Stats.ItemClass
    it will remove extra spaces so you can use: wand | shield | body armour

Added the ability to import and export the JSON strings
    Import and Export directly from the Clipboard
    You can share these JSON strings on the forum!
        Lets see what people can come up with
        I will add them to wiki for examples
    Added the ability to duplicate the Group directly from export
        Click the export button then click duplicate

Added dropdownlist for setting default stashtab in LootFilter
    Saves to its own INI in the data folder

Version .05.01 September/11/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
added missing failsafe checks for utility buttons
    Will no longer fire Utility when on Chat, Hideout, Inventory or not on Char
    Misnamed KeyUtility1-5

added belt type to Stats.ItemClass as "Belts"
    Also can now use to match "Amulets" and "Rings"
    This requires a JSON file to download, check error log for issues

Added status check the moment before firing Life/ES flask to confirm if still OnChar
    This should fix the issue with flasks firing on the instance management panel
    Instance management calibration has been removed as it is not required

Version .05.00 September/11/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom loot filter is a GO!
    The button to open the management script is on Inventory Tab
    Use the management script to edit or add to your loot filters
    Add to either Affixes, Props, or Stats for the filter rule
        Most exotic affixes are missing
    Choose the type of evaluation between >,<,=,!=,~
        ~ is to see if the min value is contained in the string
    Set the stash tab where the item will be sent
    Use the Debug tool to scan items with ItemParser checked

Added Base Armour and Weapon lists from PoE-TradeMacro
    Using it to gather Height, Width and Item Class

Armour Item Class:
    Body Armours
    Boots
    Gloves
    Helmets
    Shields

    Bows
    Claws
    Daggers

    Sceptres
    Staves
    Thrusting One Hand Swords
    Two Hand Axes
    Two Hand Maces
    Two Hand Swords
    Wands
    Warstaff

If you want to match for just one handed 
    Stats.ItemClass is the key to match against
    use ~ as the evaluator
    In min put "one hand"
    same for any string you want to only match part of

Adjustments to the display of debug messages for controllers
    if controller support is turned off, no debug messages will display

Fix for controller joystick drifting
    adjustments to joystick thresholds to prevent false positives
    
Itemsort function now opens inventory if it is not already open
    this allows one button to act as inventory and also sort for controllers

    Use the key dropdown boxes to choose a script function, or an ingame key
    Lootvacuum on the controller by assigning the loot pickup key
    Key thing to note:
        Press load to redetect joysticks
        Disconnecting an active controller requires a script reload
        There is nothing I can do about this, AHK does not detect removal
        buttons are configured for default keybinds, match to your style

 Adjustment to GottaGoFast script load, attempting to fix rogue issues

 Fixed Chat Hotkeys not becoming unregistered when disabled from enabled.

 Added Weapon dps parsing to the backend, ItemProp now has these stats:
    TotalDps, AttackSpeed, PhysLo, PhysHi, IsWeapon, PhysMult, PhysDps,

    Added two Hotkey sections which are for commands and reply whispers
    modifier editboxes can be blank or 1 or 2 modifier keys
    the keys themselves can also have modifiers such as ^ ! + or #
    this allows you to put a maximum modifier of 8 keys! XD
        Rediculous Example: Modifiers: A, D Keys: ^!+#1 & ^!+#2
        A and D together would activate Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win+( 1 & 2 )
    Command section is a regular Enter and the Reply Whisper are Ctrl+Enter

    also makes the whole piece move together easier
    
Fixed hotkeys remaining in effect after being changed until next restart.
    Simply needed to move the hotkey reset BEFORE the gui is submit

Had to rewrite how the script checks if you press flasks for the passthrough
    now it is on a very short timer that just checks the state of 1-5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release Notes .04 August/10/2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the last release there has been a lot of work done to the script!

Backend improvements to how the script handles your settings, as well as making
profiles easier to use and centralizing all the relevant settings. With the 
introduction of the utility section I figured it was time to move it around.
Also how it handles Mana and Quicksilver flasks has been vastly improved. Now it
creates a list of all the flasks that are off cooldown, and goes through the list
in order when the previous one finishes cooldown.

People using scaled versions of the script should see improvements with how the
inventory sort function works. Sauron-Dev has been testing on a scaled resolution
and added some great changes to how it determines empty inventory slots.

Additions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fully fleshed out Utility function
    5 Generic utility keys that can be configured to:
        Fire on cooldown if there are no combination of triggers below
        Trigger when pressing a Quicksilver
        Trigger when at 20-90% Life
        Trigger when at 20-90% ES

Utility Management has been added to profiles
    Configure Each utility for a specific build!
	Now with all the settings in one place that profiles save and load

Profiles which have not been used now act as a blank slate for the GUI
    Press the load # button on a slot you have not used to unselect everything

Sauron-Dev has added:
    New method of determining items in inventory, should now scale without issues
    New calibration button to determine empty item slots colors
    New function to return an index of matching values from an array
	New function to deal with strings and arrays

Using Sauron-Dev's additions
    Implimented the same changes for Mouseover color
    Added calibration button to determine Mouseover Colors

Added Ding() function for debugging
    Can take up to 7 lines of input strings
    These only show when debug is checked

Added a timer for checking if the attack key has been held down
    Good news for those builds that holds down one key *META CYCLONE*
	
Added option to turn off Auto-Update


UI Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-Organized the Tabs of the GUI, combined several tabs together.
    All Flasks and Utilities related options are now presented together in one page
    Added a messagebox for explaining how to use the calibration buttons

Bug-Fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed AutoQuit variables in the main timer

Mana Flasks now Fire sequentially to prevent overlap.

Removed a lot of unnecessary loading and GUI altering.
    Several checkboxes have been added default checked state

    Radiobuttons can be Checked by default as well

Set default INI settings straight from the ReadFromFile() in both scripts
    This should fix any further issues with loading from incomplete settings.ini
