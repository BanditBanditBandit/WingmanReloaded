With the project being larger and larger in scope, it has become a realization that it is good practice to advice those who would like to contribute to the code.

For readablity this project is using spaces instead of tabs, with an indent of 2 spaces

Allow for functions to take several lines, with fully exposed brackets and indentation of enclosed code
This allows for people reading the code to see which portions belong to each other more easily.
This rule should never apply to single line if/else/elseif statements, which should remain without brackets unless required.

All revisions are submitted to the Alpha branch to be staged and tested before being merged to Master.

Code revision is very much welcome, but we ask that functionality remains equivalent or improved.
Revisions of major systems which require breaking installation must be done on their own branch before merging to Alpha
